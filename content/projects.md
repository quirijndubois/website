# Projects

On this page you can find some of the programming projects I have been working on. I try to open source as much as I can!

## Phanim

Phanim is an open source python library designed to render, simuilate and animate simplified physical processes.

## PhanimJS
:Coming soon
PhanimJS is a more streamlined version of Phanim written in Javascript for the web. This project is still under heavy development, but seems more promising than the original Phanim project.

## WebGL
:Coming soon
I also have a few experimental web projects focused on the use of webGL. For example, I have written spherical texture projection and atmosphere simulation. These are written in shaders that can be ran on the GPU.
